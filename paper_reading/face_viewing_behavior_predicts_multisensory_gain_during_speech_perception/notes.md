# Notes

We hypothesized that the multisensory gain has two other possible causes:

- Group 1 noticed discrepancy between audio and video and hence looked more at the mouth; Group 1 uses incongruent stimuli (is this the reason why the results for this are more significant?) and group 2 uses congrument stimuli
    - Todo: remove the discrepancy
- Participants who looked more at the month might be better lipreaders
    - Todo: also measure lipreading ability and see how it correlates with % mouth-looking



Ways looking at mouth can contribute to better lip-reading:

- Long-term pairing between words and lip actions

Ways better lip-reading can contribute to looking at mouth:

- Notice a huge source of information
