Open Science Discussion Questions (reading buddies):

1. Opening questions: What are the practices of HARKing, p-hacking, and cherry-picking data?
    - harking: hypothesizing after results are known
        - Why bad:
            - disconnection from past research
    - p-hacking: making analytic decisions as to which variables or even which participants to include, so that the p-value becomes significant
    - cherry-picking data: choose to report somethings but not others
2. Mellor et al. states that the “internet has largely eliminated obstacles to sharing materials, scripts, and data” (2018, p. 1). The internet has been around for a while, why are efforts to make the research process more transparent only a recent movement? Why might the risks of openness dissuade researchers from making their materials and protocols publicly accessible? 
    - Risks for openness: 
        - Openness may reveal errors, leaving the researcher open to criticism. 
        - Openness gives advantage to other scientists, which can harm the individual in an ultra-competitive market of jobs. 
        - Openness increases the accountability of researchers - it becomes harder for a researcher to fool herself, and makes it easier for others to assess the basis for her claims. 
        - Thus, it is feared, openness could make it more difficult to publish.
3. Do you think that the worries about open science are justified?
    - Yes, especially this: “Openness gives advantage to other scientists, which can harm the individual in an ultra-competitive market of jobs.” I don’t know if Julia thinks that this is true. How does Julia think about these issues? How do you (Naseem) think about these issues.
4. What does Mellor et al. argue is the most important justification for not sharing data? What options do scientists have when data cannot ethically be shared publicly?
    - WE SHARE OUR DATA.
5. Why should researchers include generality statements? Is our use of generality statements in the Perception Lab sufficient?
    - TMR
6. Why is peaking bad?
    - Because peaking can affect behavior of experimenters.
