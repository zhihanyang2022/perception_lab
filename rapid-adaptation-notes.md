notes

 - x: trial number
 - y: mean response time to secondary task
 - observation: 
	 - response time decreases the fastest for the first 20 trials for both native and nonnative data
- importance:
	- show that rapid adaptation happened in the first 20 trials
	- by assuming that practice effect is small and large adaptation probably overrode the practice effect ...
	- lead to the exploratory analysis (figure 3)

notes:
- model comparison:
	- models
		- accent, trial number, accent-and-trial interaction (better fit)
		- accent, trial number
	- result
		- response time decreased faster for non-native than native (p=0.046)
		- conditional R value is 0.59
	- conclusion
		- weak evidence (because of the p-value) that participants adapt more quickly to nonnative than native speech in the early stages of exposure
		- require further research due to the lack of data
   - importance
	   - expose problems in the current methodology
	   - lead to thoughts on potential improvements
